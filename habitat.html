    <h1>Red Panda Habitat</h1>
    <p>Red pandas live in temperate forests of the Himalayas, including Bhutan, Nepal, India, Myanmar, and China. They prefer areas with bamboo forests and moderate temperatures.</p>

    <p>These forests are often at high elevations, and red pandas spend a lot of time in the trees. Bamboo makes up most of their diet, so dense bamboo thickets are essential for their survival.</p>

    <p>Preserving these habitats is crucial because deforestation and habitat fragmentation are major threats to red pandas.</p>
